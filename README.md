## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide W. Avy with information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He specifically wanted temperature statistics on the months of June and December in order to determine if the shop would be sustainable year-round before making the decision to open.

## Results
* When comparing the statistics from June and December, June has an average temperature about 4 degrees warmer than December. The average temperatures for those months are roughly around the same.
* June has a minimum temp of 64 degrees while December's is 56. There is quite a difference in these minimum temperatures so we might see sales in June on the coldest days at a higher rate.
* June has a maximum temp of 85 degrees while December's is 83 degrees. Being only a 2 degrees difference we could see about even sales on these max temp days.
## Summary
Overall, the temperature data for either month is about the same. The data we have found supports having the shop open year-round! I would definitely run a query to check the percipitation data on those months and compare them as it would have some affect on sales. Another query would be how much rainfall each month received.
